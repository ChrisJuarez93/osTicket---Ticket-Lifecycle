As an admin I created a few tickets so the agent could solve them. Them being Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7) entire mobile/online banking system is down, Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7) accounting needs adobe upgrade, Sev-B/C (2 hours, business hours) CFO's laptop seems a bit slow. I then switched to the agent panel and logged in as a Jane Doe.

I then chose the most severe ticket which was entire mobile/online banking system is down set priority to emergency. For the department I assigned to System Aministrators.

I had to coordinate with the System Administrator and we found a resolution with the mobile/ online banking system. I clicked the status of the ticket to resolve and closed the ticket.
